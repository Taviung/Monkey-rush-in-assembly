# Monkey-rush-in-assembly
This is a project of mine created in assembly using the Canvas framework.
The idea of the game is to collect as many bananas as you can without hitting your head on the falling blocks.
The more you stay near a banana, the more you collect, and with every key press, the game moves faster.
Enjoy!
